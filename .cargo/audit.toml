    # === VULNERABILITIES ===
    
    # ring 0.16.20 AES panic vulnerability (RUSTSEC-2025-0009)
    # ------------------------------------------------
    # Source: ethers -> ethers-providers -> jsonwebtoken -> ring 0.16.20
    # Issue: AES functions may panic when overflow checking is enabled
    # Risk Assessment: LOW
    #   - Not exploitable in JWT validation context used by ethers
    #   - No QUIC protocol usage in our codebase
    #   - Affects 1 in 2^32 packets, not applicable to our use case
    # Mitigation Plan:
    #   - Short-term: Documented acceptance with low risk
    #   - Long-term: Migration to Alloy (ethers replacement) in v1.0
    # Tracking: Part of Alloy migration roadmap (see PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md)
