    # ring 0.16.20 vulnerability via ethers -> jsonwebtoken dependency chain

    # but this specific code path is not used in JWT validation by ethers-providers
    # Mitigation: Scheduled for migration to Alloy in next major version
    # Risk: Low - not exploitable in our use case (no QUIC protocol usage)
